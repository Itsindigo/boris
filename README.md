## README

### Objective
The aim of this project is to build a vanilla Ruby application to simulate the management and tracking of Boris Bikes.
I intend to complete this project using best OOP practices, referencing Sandi Metz's *Principles of Object Oriented Design*, Test Driving my application,
and using Code Climate to evaluate test-coverage and DRY-ness.
